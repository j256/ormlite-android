ORMLite Android
===============

This package provides the Android specific functionality.  You will also need to download the [ormlite-core](https://github.com/j256/ormlite-core) package as well.  Users that are connecting to SQL databases via JDBC connections should
download the [ormlite-jdbc](https://github.com/j256/ormlite-jdbc) package instead of this Android one.
